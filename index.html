                    Seventeen, when I met you
                    <br>
                    Everything was new
                    <br>
                    I fell so, so quickly
                    <br>
                    You made it hard not to
                    <br>
                    I knew all the ins and outs
                    <br>
                    Of everything you were about
                    <br>
                    <span>And you knew me more than anybody</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>All my dreams and doubts</span>

                    There have since been other flares
                    <br>
                    But no one ever compares
                    <br>
                    To the warmth that you exuded
                    <br>

                <p class="letter-paragraph">I would like to take this opportunity to tell you how much 
                    impact you have made in my life. I’ve known you for a long time and losing 
                    you since then was a great loss that I still haven’t fully adjusted from. 
                    Truth be told, I think I’m fine with admitting that I haven’t made an effort to 
                    move on from you because of the reason that I don’t want to. I still wear 
                    the necklace with your ring as a pendant everyday in hopes of another miracle 
                    might occur, who knows? Maybe we could get back together. That’s always the 
                    thought inside my head.</p>
                <p class="letter-paragraph">I also want to tell you how severe my burnout is. I can 
                    barely keep my shit together (lol don’t mind the lies I told you in the 
                    author section) but I can still keep it together nonetheless. The past 
                    3 months were the worst and I kept on contacting you in hopes of 
                    feeling better. I’m telling you this because I’m comfortable with you 
                    knowing the shit I’m dealing with and I don’t mean to make you feel bad 
                    with this. I just want you to be there and listen, as a friend, stranger, 
                    an ex, I don’t know. All I know is that in your presence is where I find my 
                    comfort and peace. </p>
                <p class="letter-paragraph">I mentioned that this is the culmination of my 
                    feelings, and it is. This is me telling you my desires and what I want for 
                    the both of us. I want to spend my future with you. I want to see you 
                    graduate and succeed in life. I want to be there in your lowest and 
                    celebrate with you in your highest. I want you also to be there for me, 
                    to be my comfort in trying times and the one I first look for whenever I 
                    achieve a goal in life. This is me now thinking that I’ve grown myself 
                    enough to consider myself worthy of telling you again the words I love you. 
                    Losing you made me realize how incomplete my life was without you. 
                    You are the only person in this world who truly compliments me. This 
                    is me not saying I need you but instead how much I want you.</p>
                <p class="letter-paragraph">I made this with the intent of showing 
                    you how genuine and sincere my feelings are. I know that 
                    you are also dealing with a lot of things right now but I 
                    want you to know that I understand. I will always understand you 
                    and be patient with you. </p>
